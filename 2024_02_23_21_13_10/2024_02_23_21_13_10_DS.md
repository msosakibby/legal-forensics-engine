### **Personal Finance Observations & Advice**

*   **Excellent Job on Fees:** You paid **$0 in fees and $0 in interest** this period. This indicates good account management, likely by paying your balance in full in previous months. Keep it up!
*   **High-Frequency Spending:** You made 6 trips to the Meijer gas station in under a month. While this may be necessary, you could consider filling your tank completely on each visit to reduce the number of trips and transactions you need to track.
*   **Card Usage:** All your spending is at Meijer, which is what this card is designed for. Ensure you are taking full advantage of any rewards points or discounts offered for using the card at their stores and gas stations.
