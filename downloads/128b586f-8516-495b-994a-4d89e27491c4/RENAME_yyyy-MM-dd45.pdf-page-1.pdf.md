# FINANCE CHARGES AND DAILY PERIODIC RATE

FINANCE CHARGES. Finance charges are imposed from the date each loan is posted to your Account. Finance charges are computed on the daily balance of your Account in the following manner:

1. The daily balance is the beginning balance of your Account each day in the current billing period, plus any loans or fees charged to your Account that day, less any payments or credits posted to your Account that day. The daily balance does not include finance charges.
2. The daily balance for each day during the current billing period is multiplied by the daily periodic rate, yielding the finance charge for each such day;
3. The finance charges for each day during the current billing period are then added together to determine the total finance charge for the current billing period.

DAILY PERIODIC RATE. The daily periodic rate may vary from one billing period to the next.

# IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS TO/FROM YOUR ACCOUNT:

Telephone Chemical Bank at the phone number listed on the front of your statement or write to Chemical Bank at the address on the front of your statement; as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong, or if you need more information about a transfer on the statement or receipt.

The Bank will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly.
