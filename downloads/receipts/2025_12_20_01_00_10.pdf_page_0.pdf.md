Dear Judith Grandy,

Enclosed for your records, you will find a summary of purchases made at Tractor Supply Company during 2007. Although this is not an official tax document, our hope is that you will find it useful.

The attached statement includes all purchases made at Tractor Supply during the 2007 calendar year in which you identified yourself as Tax-Exempt during checkout. Many of our customers shop at more than one of our stores and may have opened more than one Tax-Exempt account. We have done our best to combine these purchase histories when we were reasonably sure they were the same customer.

We have also included some money-saving coupons as a 'thank-you' for shopping with us. We greatly appreciate your business and look forward to serving you in 2008.

Sincerely,

Your Friends at Tractor Supply Company

A 45 000267793 000350255
