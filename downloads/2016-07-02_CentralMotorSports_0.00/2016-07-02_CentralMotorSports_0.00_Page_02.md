# To Register Change Of Vehicle Ownership

The Honda Protection Plan becomes a part of the vehicle for which it was originally purchased. The plan coverage cannot be transferred to another vehicle. The second owner of a covered vehicle should make sure that the change of ownership information is registered with American Honda. At no charge to you, an authorized Honda dealer will help register your vehicle's change of ownership with American Honda.

# To Terminate Coverage

You may be eligible for a refund if you are the Original Honda Protection Plan Purchaser. You may request cancellation of the Honda Protection Plan through any authorized Honda Motorcycle dealer. You must be the Legal Owner and the vehicle must be in your possession.
